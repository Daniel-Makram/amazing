## Comments
### What I did
- I created a level generator( levels may not always be hard but are always solvable)
- I added a level counter
- I made sure that music wasn't too loud on load and volume shouldn't change between levels.

### What I would like to add/change
- I would've liked to add a stopwatch(code is in comments, could not figure bug)
- Adding the title to the top would be nice but queryselector are tricky with my level generator
- Change the rainbow gif to have transparency
- Add moving stars in the background
- Level creator for users?
- Change the Victory alert to a nicer animation
- Difficulty rating?
